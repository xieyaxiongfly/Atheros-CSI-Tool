## Overview
Channel State Information (CSI) provides per-subcarrier complex channel responses at the PHY layer, enabling a broad class of research in:
- **Wi-Fi sensing** (human activity recognition, respiration, gesture, tracking)
- **Localization / channel analytics** (AoA/ToF-related processing, fingerprinting)
- **Wireless measurement and debugging**
- **Cross-layer studies** bridging PHY measurements and networking systems

**Atheros-CSI-Tool** exposes CSI from off-the-shelf Atheros 802.11n chipsets via the open-source Linux driver stack (ath9k), enabling reproducible experiments on commodity platforms (PCs / embedded boards / routers).

---

## Key features (research-focused)
- **Fine-grained CSI per packet**: complex-valued CSI across OFDM subcarriers, with antenna dimensions depending on MIMO configuration.
- **Rich per-packet metadata** (varies by platform/config): timestamps, RSSI per chain, rate/MCS, payload, and driver-level info useful for controlled experiments.
- **Commodity-friendly**: operates on widely available Atheros 802.11n NICs supported by `ath9k` without firmware hacking.
- **Multiple receivers support**: one transmission can be captured by multiple receivers, each reporting its CSI stream, facilitating distributed measurement setups.
- **Extensible workflow**: pair kernel-side CSI extraction with the provided user-space capture/parsing utilities for dataset logging and downstream processing.

---

## Supported / validated hardware
The tool targets Atheros 802.11n chipsets supported by `ath9k`. Commonly validated chipsets include:
- **AR9580**
- **AR9590**
- **AR9344**
- **QCA9558**

## Getting started (recommended path)
This repository contains kernel-side components for CSI extraction.  
For end-to-end CSI logging and dataset generation, please follow the website documentation:

1) **Read the documentation portal**  
   https://wands.hk/external/wifi/AtherosCSI/index.html

2) **Choose your platform guide**
- **Ubuntu version** (PC/laptop/desktop): build + driver integration steps
- **OpenWRT version** (routers): cross-compile / image integration steps

3) **Use the user-space tools to capture & parse CSI streams**  
   https://github.com/xieyaxiongfly/Atheros-CSI-Tool-UserSpace-APP

> In most deployments, users first complete the driver/toolchain setup from the website, then use the user-space app to log CSI and export it into Matlab/Python-friendly formats.

## CSI format notes (for researchers)
In OFDM Wi-Fi systems, CSI is typically represented as a complex tensor per received packet, e.g.:
- 20 MHz: commonly **Ntx × Nrx × 56 subcarriers**
- 40 MHz: commonly **Ntx × Nrx × 114 subcarriers**

Exact dimensions and header fields depend on bandwidth / NIC / configuration.
